### Welcome to my swamp!

So... to sum up, I'm a freelancer and consultant, specializing in Fullstack, Frontend and UX in the Typescript + Node/Bun space. Most of my activity is private because, you know... clients. Except for the occasional brainrot project, of course. And by occasional I mean frequent.
