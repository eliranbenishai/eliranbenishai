### Welcome to my swamp!

So... to sum up, I'm a freelancer and consultant, specializing in Frontend and UX but as an extension, am also capable of carrying out Fullstack applications in the JS/TS Node/Deno/Bun space. Most of my repos are private since they deal with my main side-project [sic.place](https://sic.place) - do feel free to join and say hello.
